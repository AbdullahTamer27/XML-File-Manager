## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies
- inside src each functionality is put in folder of its own with all its files 
- the files outside are only files for gui and the bonus parts 

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.


## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).

We are using JAVAFX SDK 19.0.2.1 with java 17

You should have GraphVis for the visualization to work 

You should give it the full Path of the file

the dependencies for everything is supposed to be included but you need to add them into the project you create in order for it to run properly

Try to avoid empty lines in the xml for the project to work properly
