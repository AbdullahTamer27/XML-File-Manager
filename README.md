## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies
- inside src each functionality is put in folder of its own with all its files 
- the files outside are only files for gui and the bonus parts 

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.


## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).

We are using JAVAFX SDK 19.0.2.1 with java 17
